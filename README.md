# 🩸 iDonat – AI-Powered Blood Donation Platform

## 📌 Overview

iDonat is an **AI-driven blood donation and transfusion management platform** designed to address Nigeria’s alarming blood supply deficit, where the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) reports a **60% shortage**. The platform leverages **agentic AI and IBM watsonx** to **connect donors, hospitals, and patients** seamlessly while predicting demand, optimizing supply, and building a culture of continuous blood donation.

Every unit of blood donated can save **up to three lives**. iDonat ensures that **no patient dies due to preventable shortages**.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

* Nigeria requires **1.8 million units of blood annually** but collects less than **40% of this demand**.
* Pregnant women, accident victims, cancer patients, and children are disproportionately affected.
* Lack of **real-time donor–hospital coordination** leads to delayed responses during emergencies.
* Low awareness and poor donor retention rates make supply unpredictable.


## 💡 Solution – How iDonat Works

iDonat uses **multi-agent AI architecture** built on IBM watsonx to power a real-time, scalable, and intelligent blood donation ecosystem:

1. **Donor Engagement Agent** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

   * Encourages regular donations via conversational AI.
   * Sends personalized reminders and health tips.
   * Matches donors with nearby hospitals based on blood group.

2. **Hospital Matching Agent** 🏥

   * Provides real-time hospital inventory dashboards.
   * Predicts shortages using demand forecasting models.
   * Alerts hospitals of emergency donor availability.

3. **Emergency Response Agent** 🚑

   * Prioritizes urgent blood requests.
   * Automatically finds and notifies the closest eligible donor.
   * Integrates with **USSD/SMS** for offline accessibility.

4. **Awareness & Education Agent** 📣

   * Runs AI-powered campaigns and Q\&A chatbots.
   * Educates citizens about the safety and benefits of donation.
   * Uses gamification & leaderboards to build community participation.

💡 Why iDonat?

iDonat was born from real conversations with blood donors—especially on World Blood Donor Day (14th June)—to deeply understand their needs, challenges, and motivations. Many people shared that they were unaware of the importance of regular blood donation or lacked access to timely, trusted information. This user-first approach continues to guide our platform’s design and evolution.

Every year, thousands of lives are lost in Nigeria due to the lack of timely access to safe blood. Shortages in supply, poor awareness, and inefficient donor–recipient matching contribute to preventable deaths—especially among women during childbirth, accident victims, and children with anemia.

iDonat is built to change that.

🚑 For hospitals: iDonat provides a faster, smarter way to connect with verified donors and track availability in real time.
🤝 For communities: it fosters a culture of awareness, making blood donation a shared responsibility.
🩸 For individuals: it makes donating simple, safe, and rewarding—empowering donors to save lives with just one unit of blood.

By combining secure technology with human compassion, iDonat is more than an app—it’s a life-saving ecosystem designed to strengthen Nigeria’s public health infrastructure. Together, we can ensure that no patient dies due to preventable blood shortages.
